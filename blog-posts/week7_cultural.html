				<h2>Values</h2>
				<h2><img src="images/core-values.png" alt=""></h2>
				<p>What are my values? That can be a challenging question. Just because I think I hold myself to a particular value, does it show to the outside world?  Without really thinking about it I just said aloud the first three values that I find to be important to me. Knowledge, honesty, and happiness. For me I feel that if I keep knowledge and honesty high on my values list that happiness just tends to follow. Do I live up to these values everyday? Well I’m going to live up to one of them right now and I have to say no. There are rough days for me every now and then. Lets be honest, some days its just hard to be happy. There isn’t any one thing that we know is making us unhappy, but yet we just can’t seem to enjoy anything that day. It happens, we’re all human. With knowledge, its not that I have stupid days, its more of instead of the hunger and interest to watch a tutorial, or read some chapters from a book, the seductive Netflix’s crosses my eyes. During Phase 0 I’ve realized that sometimes you just have to take a break from learning. I do really enjoy it, but that won’t keep you from getting burned out on it. I enjoy running just as much, but if I forced myself to go running everyday for hours and hours, I would get burnt out on it and loose the drive to do it. Lastly comes honesty. No lies here, there are some days where its just easier to bend the truth a little when talking to someone. I’m not saying that its okay, but I am saying that it happens to me. Overall if I had to rate how well I follow my values it would be close to this, knowledge = 4, honesty = 3.8 and happiness = 4.5.</p>
				<p>I think having and thinking about your values can help to minimize the effect of stereotype threat on someone. You’re values can go completely against your stereotype. That can prove to you that a stereotype has no control over you. You just have to ignore the stereotype and focus on your values. It might be hard to do some days, but it’s something that will get easier over time.</p>
				<p>At DBC, if for any reason I am feeling down, it will probably be loosing confidence that I can get through it and become a developer. All I have to think is how much knowledge I have already gained from this experience and how happy that has made me. Also how happy I will be when I achieve one of my goals and earn the career that I want to have. That little tiny amount of motivation will help me get through any of the hard times to come. I think it would be good for everyone to have some kind of mental motivation for when they hit a tough patch.</p>
