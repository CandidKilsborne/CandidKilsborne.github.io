				<h2>Pairing</h2>
				<p>Pairing has the ability to be a little bit of every emotion for me. There’s nervous, scared, rewarding, fun, learning, challenging, and easy. It’s always a mixture of them. First going into a pairing session remotely with someone you’ve never met is daunting. You have to work on completing a task with someone that you don’t know. The nerves start going crazy. I think for me the reason I get nervous goes back to my fears of DBC altogether. I don’t want to be the person that’s bringing down the pair. I still have the fear that I’m not getting it like everyone else is. I spend time on Ruby Docs and reading books on Ruby and trying to wrap my head around all of it. In my head I have the wonder of “what if they just breeze through the challenge and I’m left in the dust trying to put the pieces together so I can understand the solution?” For the most part that is the start of every pairing session for me with few exceptions.</p>
				<p>Now to clarify, there have never been pairing sessions that have been like that, its just my self brought on fear of them. Every pairing session starts with fear and then moves to becoming more comfortable with the person. It’s nice, getting the jitters out and just having a conversation with the other person really helps me with the session. It’s nice to show my brain, “see this person is nice and this is going to be a really good session. They’re not going to make me feel dumb or bad about myself.”</p>
				<p>Sit rep, myself : 1 vs my fear: 1. My fear took the first round, the time before the session starts, and I took the second round, the start of the session. All tied up, now for the problem that we have to work on and solve. ‘One point to fear’, having a problem put in front of you when you’re new to programming, and having someone watching you to critic you, is a huge obstacle. Even some simple problems seem harder due to the pressure of ‘needing to get it right.’ Now I say needing to get it right meaning that I want to get it right and feel accomplished and see my goal of becoming a developer get closer. I feel every time I get super stumped and just have to say “I don’t know” that my goal is becoming further out of reach. That’s when the fear comes in to tell me that I’m not understanding it and I’m not smart enough to get it. Okay, at this point we’ve gone as far as to have the challenge in front of us, and I’m losing against myself 2 to 1. Luckily I’m paired with someone that maybe shares the same fears as myself or just knows how to handle people with an outrageous amount of fear, regardless we start talking over the problem and start tossing back some ideas of how we can break the problem down into smaller chunks. We figure out who’s going to be the driver and who is the navigator and start chipping away at it. Every guided pairing session that I’ve had, I’ve had a really good guide. They let me and my pair work out our solution and if we seem to get stuck or took a super weird turn, they help us get back on track. Sometimes it’s as if they aren’t even there, but in the best possible way. Being able to solve challenges with someone is a rewarding feeling. I feel that I learn so much in just a couple hours. It’s also nice to get to know new people and really be in the same position as them, same amount of time, same problem, roughly same experience level. Some of the problems start out by making you frustrated that you can’t just look at it and go “oh here’s the answer”. Of course once you and your pair solve it, the answer looks super simple and easy and you think in the back of your head, “why didn’t we see that solution from the start?” Overall the pairing experience is just a bunch of different experiences that happen over a short time period. For me, even though I have a slight fear of it, in the end it turns out to be such an amazing learning experience and I can walk away from them happy. Remember “Pairing is Caring”.</p>

				<h2>Feedback</h2>

				<p>Disclaimer: Do not let the image above scare you.</p>
				<p>On to the feedback portion of the pairing experience. Feedback is a great way to judge how you are understanding the material. It’s easy for a individual to read a chapter in a book and then think to themselves, “I read it, I must understand it then, I’m doing amazing at this programming thing.” I think most of us try to steer away from that, but some of us possible steer too far the other way and think that they will never understand, yet they are putting in the time and effort to be able to. With feedback, you get honest thoughts and opinions from the people that you are working with. If you understand something, they will tell you. If you don’t they will (or at least should) tell you. It’s a good method for judging where you should be spending time learning. Maybe you have the concepts and theory down, but it’s just the syntax that gives you trouble. With the pairing sessions, they can point that out to you in the feedback and then maybe next time you can be the driver to help cement the syntax in. Overall I’m really happy that DBC has this pairing and feedback system in place. It’s a super valuable system to have for learning and I think more schools, both colleges and high schools, should try to use this kind of feedback system. I think many people can further their learning much easier with it.</p>
