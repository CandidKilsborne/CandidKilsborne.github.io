				<h2>What I’ve Learned From Blogging</h2>
				<p>During Dev Bootcamps Phase 0 was my first time blogging. For me it was difficult. Writing has never been a strong skill for me. I’m always worried if I wrote too much or too little, and then have the panic of who’s actually reading my blog!? Before all of this the only online communities that I had been immersed in where gaming ones. If you want to find someone to make you feel horrible for posting something online(not sure why you would want that), go hangout in gaming forums. It gave me the sense of if I post anything, all that will come back are horrible comments putting me down. So for me there was a real fear about blogging. Thankfully Phase 0 has made that fear go away. I may not get a lot of feedback from my posts, but the feedback that I do get is nice. Also having the practice from Phase 0, I feel that my writing skill has improved as well. It still has a long way to go, but with practice, it’s headed in the right direction.</p>
				<p>One of the more challenging parts of the Phase 0 blog posts for me were the technical posts. With the cultural posts it had more of an opinion feel to it and it’s difficult to have your opinion be wrong, unless you think the show Firefly was horrible in which case your opinion is wrong. I was always terrified that my technical blog posts were incorrect. The feeling of knowing that I’m beginning to learn development and then having to possibly teach someone on something I don’t fully understand is a huge obstacle to get past. It does help further the learning and it really pays off.</p>
				<p>Overall the Phase 0 experience has been amazing. The time flew by and I never would have thought that I could learn as much as I have in the little time there was. Besides the technical skills that I’ve learned, I’ve also learned that my voice is just as important as anyone else’s and I shouldn’t hide my opinions out of the fear of being laughed at. I’ve met some amazing people, many of which I will meet in person soon. And I’ve gained confidence in myself. All I can say is thank you DBC.</p>
