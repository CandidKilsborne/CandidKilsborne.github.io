				<h2>JavaScript, The Good.</h2>
				<p>Javascript is a relatively easy language to learn and has a syntax that is close to English. I uses the Document Object Model to interact with the web page. It can be used on both on the front end and backend for development. When it's used on the client side, it can reduce the demand from the websites server. JavaScript has been around for many years, so there is a lot of documentation online. Browsers have made tools to help with JavaScript development, like Firebug or Google's Dev Tools. It can be used from adding functionality to websites to making games in Unity. It can also be used in other languages, like PHP. Overall JavaScript is a language worth knowing.</p>

				<h2>JavaScript, The Bad.</h2>
				<p>Users can override their browser and disable JavaScript, which could potentially make your app or site break. Depending on your use of JavaScript, it can be slow. If you tried to make a game with JavaScript, yes it would work, but it would be noticeably slower than most game programming languages. Also, something that has haunted JavaScript's past and still haunts it today is it's security, or lack there of. It makes a good way to infect computers, since the JavaScript code is executed on the userâ€™s computer. This is why many users disable JavaScript in their browser.</p>
