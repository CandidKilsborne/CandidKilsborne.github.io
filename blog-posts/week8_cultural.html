				<h2>Dealing With Conflict</h2>
				<h2><img src="images/green-arrow.jpg" alt="Green Traffic Arrow"></h2>
				<p>There usually are many conflicts that people run into, it’s inevitable that you will have a disagreement or misunderstanding or just a plain argument with some one sooner or later or even yourself. So for me, the worst conflict that I have is one with myself. Back when I was 17 years old, I was driving some of my friends home and we got into a car accident. My best friend Jared died on impact. The intersection where it happened did not have any cameras so there is no solid evidence on what happened. So being the younger driver, the police charged me with fault of the accident.</p>
				<p>So as you could guess, I did not handle this well. I was 17 and just wanted to get away from everything. Since I was friends with Jared and his family, there were no charges from them, just the police department. It wasn’t a go to jail type of case, just loose my license and pay a fine. I figured that there was no way of proving to the police that it wasn’t my fault and I had a green arrow when I was turning so I was ready to just give up and let them do what they wanted. The police had already told me the light I was at doesn’t work the way I described. Luckily my dad wasn’t going to give up and let this charge stay on my record, so sure enough we got a lawyer and went to court. Turns out the lawyer went to the same light and filmed it one night and it worked as I had described to the police. Turns out the officer who said I was lying wasn’t telling the truth himself. To make a long story short, I was found innocent and cleared of the charges. So why would this still get to me? It’s because to this day, I can’t remember what happened at that intersection. There is part of my that blames myself everyday for it, yet sometimes I think that “no it wasn’t my fault”. With out clear evidence it’s a mental conflict that will always be there.</p>
				<p>This incident is what I use to place myself on the “Compass of Shame”. My reactions were clearly withdrawal and self-attack. At the time it was easy to lock myself in my room away from the world. Also it was very easy for me to blame myself for everything rather than standing up for myself. I know that if I didn’t have other people there, my reactions to everything would have made that situation much worse.</p>
				<p>The going back and doing things different question is easy, if I could go back and keep the accident from happening altogether I would without hesitation. Assuming that I could only go back and just have different reactions to it, I would have to pass on it. It was one of the hardest times of my life and I wouldn’t want to go through that again.</p>
				<p>This experience showed me how easy it is to point fingers at someone in a situation. The officer, despite his lack of honesty, found it easier to blame the younger, less experienced driver verses the driver in their forties. Making the tremendous leap from that to software development, it would be easier as the novice programmer to just take the blame from someone more experienced and it would be easy for you to believe that accusation yourself. The fact is there always are two sides to a story.</p>
