				<h2>Net Neutrality</h2>
				<p>Where did Net Neutrality come from? Net Neutrality is what most every person wants. It protects our freedom of speech on the Internet and the ability to communicate freely online. During May, 2014, the FCC proposed rules that would allow internet service providers to discriminate against certain web traffic. This would split the internet into two lanes, the Autobahn and the bike lane. This now gives the ISP’s (Internet Service Providers) a way to make more money. You pay your ISP monthly to receive internet access and now they can turn around and charge companies more money to be on the “fast lane.” Let’s use Netflix as an example. The ISP can go to Netflix and tell them that a lot of their customers use Netflix daily(Awesome Netflix, you’re doing great!). So if they want to keep their users happy, Netflix should have to pay for the faster tier at the ISP or the ISP will slow down their connection and Netflix’s users will be angry at Netflix and stop paying for it.</p>
				<p>It seems to me, that if these rules get passed in court, that it would start the slow demise of the Internet. We all see stories of other countries banning certain sites to the public, what if that spreads. No it’s currently the ISP’s for us here that could limit sites, but once they are able to how long until the government decides that it’s a good idea for them to start having a say on what we can visit online.</p>
				<p>The Internet Service Providers should take a look at what they are and do just that, provide Internet service, not try to make it a tiered system. Open Internet for all is what we, especially the web community, should all be demanding. Don’t leave these decisions up to the government or the companies that would benefit from a tiered system.</p>
				<p>The video below is a must watch for anyone that is confused by Net Neutrality. Please give a watch.</p>
