				<h2>The (Pre)Dev Bootcamp Experience Thoughts</h2>
				<p>I A lot of my fears and concerns were put to rest with the <strong>Fireside</strong> video. The DBC experience seems to be a group experience. Being together with like-minded people all striving to be the best developers than can be and learn as much as they can. I am very excited for this experience. Being completely emerged and achieving things that I never thought I could. I am very shy, at first, so making myself reach out to people, some I don't know, and asking for help is very challenging for me. The challenge is the best possible kind. I need to work on getting rid of the fear of being wrong, or looking dumb in front of everyone. I have already taken steps toward that with the Google group and need to work harder with that and really engage with the members of all the cohorts of DBC. Dev Bootcamp's learning environment of everyone working as hard as they ever have, happily doesn't worry me. It's more of an excited feeling and I can't wait to jump into it. How people can come in, roll up their sleeves, and essentially become part of the team. Both learning and teaching and help further a better learning experience for the group make me very excited. The overall experience makes me nervous, but only because of my fears. I can identify with the students that come in feeling that everyone in their cohort is leaps and bounds better and more advanced than themselves. I know that some of my obstacles are more self inflicted. I have found that writing reflections is really hard for me. Am I giving the <em>correct</em> answer? When people read my reflection do they laugh at it? What if I completely misunderstood the question? All fears that Phase 0 is helping me overcome. I look forward to even more benefits from future challenges.</p>
